    Montana uses the Zepter CLI to detect abnormalities in Cargo features and dependencies.

    It looks like one or more checks failed; please check the console output.

    You can try to automatically address them by installing zepter (`cargo install zepter --locked`) and simply running `zepter` in the workspace root.
